Creepair
========

This plugin was originally coded by [jamietech](https://gist.github.com/jamietech) for us.

Basically, the goal of this plugin is to repair natural creeper-exploded blocks near, or above, ground level.

Much of the detail was coded by [modwizcode](https://github.com/modwizcode) and thanks to her, this plugin is fully functioning.
